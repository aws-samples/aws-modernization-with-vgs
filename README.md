## Description

 ## What is a workshop?

In this workshop you will learn why DevOps and DevSecOps teams are turning to Data Security as a Service (DSaaS) providers, like Very Good Security (VGS), to secure sensitive data, streamline their workflows, and descope sensitive data from their tech stack to accelerate their journey to information security compliances like PCI DSS, SOC 2, GDPR, and more. VGS will demonstrate how you can rapidly deploy scalable, military-grade data protection tools that save time, cut costs, reduce architecture complexity, and compliance scope.

 ## Learning Objectives

- To understand how to integrate VGS Collect into client-side applications to descope your client-side applications from sensitive data.
- To understand how to configure the VGS HTTP Proxies to descope server-side applications from sensitive data.
- To understand the benefits of owning and controlling your sensitive data while remaining descoped from the sensitive data and continue to do business as usual.
- To understand how VGS offloads the data security, compliance, and liability headaches, that come when dealing with sensitive data, for its customers.
