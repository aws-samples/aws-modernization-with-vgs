![Partner Logo](/images/vgs-logo-color.png)  

## Welcome

In this workshop you will learn why DevOps and DevSecOps teams are turning to Data Security as a Service (DSaaS) providers, like Very Good Security (VGS), to secure sensitive data, streamline their workflows, and descope sensitive data from their tech stack to accelerate their journey to information security compliances like PCI DSS, SOC 2, GDPR, and more. VGS will demonstrate how you can rapidly deploy scalable, military-grade data protection tools that save time, cut costs, reduce architecture complexity, and compliance scope.
